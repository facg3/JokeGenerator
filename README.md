# Jokes Generator
##### This is the cure for your depression without a doubt. This life is so stressful, full of bullies and sometimes unbearable! Thus, we decided to make this app to save lives :)

## Who are we:
#### We are Walaa, Hanan and Mohammed, and we consider ourselves life savers. <3

## What is Jokes Generator:
#### Jokes Generator is a web app which gives you the ability to view jokes randomly online and have non-stop laughing using the power of memes.

## How was it done:
#### Starting off from making the file structure of our project, we separated it into two parts, Front-End folder & Back-End folder.

#### Front-End (public):
###### >index.html
###### >style.css
###### >index.js

#### Back-End (src):
###### >handler.js
###### >router.js
###### >server.js

#### Briefly, the server launches, sends requests to the APIs, makes a connection and waits for other requests from the user in the front-end. Once done, the server with the help of the handlers will send a request, and receive a response (which is a random joke + random funny image) and will display it to the user. Cool, right?

##### Feel free to view our app using [heroku](https://jokegenerator.herokuapp.com).
